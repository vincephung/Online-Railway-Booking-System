CS 336 Principles of Information and Data Management at Rutgers University

Professor Antonio Miranda

Fall 2020

## Project Description
The goal of the project was to design and implement a relational database system that supports the operations of an online railway booking system. 
The booking system allows users to browse/search transit lines, make train reservations over the web, and query the database for available train schedules.

## User Functionality
### Manager/Admin-Level Functionality
* Add, Edit and Delete information for a customer representative
* Obtain a sales report per month (total revenue per month)
* Produce a list of reservations by transit line or by customer name
* Produce the total revenue generated by a particular transit line, or customer
* Determine which customer generated most total revenue
* Produce a list of the 5 most active transit lines (most reservations per month) 

### Customer-Representative-Level Functionality 
* Edit and Delete information for train schedules
* Reply to customer questions
* Produce a list of all customers who have reservations on a given transit line and
date
* Produce a list of all schedules for a given station (both as origin and as destination)
(e.g. list of train schedules that have New Brunswick as origin, or list of train
schedules that have NB as destination)

### Customer-Level Functionality 
* Make reservations for a one-way or round-trip
* Cancel reservations
* Retrieve a history of all current/past reservations
* Retrieve travel itinerary for a given reservation
* Ask questions to customer service

## Technologies Used
* HTML, CSS(Bootstrap) for the user interface,
* MySQL for the database server
* Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server. 
* Web server hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services)
